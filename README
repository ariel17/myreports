=================================================

By Ariel Gerardo RÃ­os (ariel.gerardo.rios@gmail.com)


Description
-----------

This is a personal project realized in Python language and Django v1.3 web
framework. Basically, it is a statistic collector and customizable reports
generator for one or more MySQL servers configured.


About my problem
----------------

The motivation to do this kind of system was, in a few words, bad project
managing, inexistence of deployment politics and a missing database
administration inside an organization where I was working once. Databases were
created on-demand, inside -any- MySQL server "available", used all the time
needed, and then forgeted; so for database owner, its life cycle was "Creation
-> Use -> Forget". It becomes a quickly a problem for all that it represents:
disk space comsumption, access control and overhead.
