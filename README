* MyReports * Statistic reports for MySQL servers
=================================================

By Ariel Gerardo RÃ­os (ariel.gerardo.rios@gmail.com)


Description
-----------

This is a personal project realized in Python language and Django v1.3 web
framework. Basically consists in a MySQL variable-value collector and a
customizable report generator for one or more MySQL servers configured.


About my problem
----------------

The motivation to do this kind of system was, in few words, bad project
managing, inexistence of deployment politics and a missing database
administration inside an organization where I was working once. Databases were
almost everywhere, inside -any- MySQL server "at hand" and once they finished
their life time they pass to oblivion. It becomes a quickly a problem for all
that it represents: disk space comsumption, access control and overhead.

About this solution
-------------------

This odd "Creation -> Use -> Forget" database management politic must be
corrected.
